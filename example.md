In markdown you can use inline code blocks, like so: `echo $PATH`

You can also use code blocks, like so:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```

If you add a single linebreak in the markdow text,
the rendered output will still place it in the same line

If you add two linebreaks int the markdown text,

the rendered output will split the lines.
